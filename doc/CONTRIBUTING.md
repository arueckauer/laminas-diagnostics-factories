# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/arueckauer/laminas-diagnostics-factories).

## Pull Requests

-   **[Laminas Coding Standard](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-coding-standard/)** - Check the code style with `$ composer cs-check`.

-   **Add tests!** - Patches without tests will not be accepted.

-   **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are up-to-date.

-   **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

-   **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

-   **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#_changing_multiple) before submitting.

## Running Tests

```bash
$ composer test
```

**Happy coding**!
